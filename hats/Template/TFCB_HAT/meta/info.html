<h1>TFCB</h1>
<h2>Expansion Hat</h2>

<p>This project template is the basis of an expansion hat for the
TFCB.</a></p>

<p>This base project includes a PCB edge defined as the same size as the
TFCB base PCB with the connectors placed correctly to align the two boards.
All IO present on the TFCB is connected to the project through the
0.1" expansion headers.</p>
