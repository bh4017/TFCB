# DESCRIPTION

A PIC 18F87J50 platform consisting of a baseboard which provides a means to easily design interface 'hats' for adding functionality.  

The baseboard includes all the basic components necessary to run an 18F87J50 Microcontroller, plus some communications ports (USB, RS232, SPI) and on-board power supplies.

The baseboard breaks out the 18F87J50 pins to 2.54mm IO which allows hats to be easily created by professional and amateur electronics users.  It is possible to build hats from stripboard or custom PCBs.  The 18F87J50 is extremely well equipped and even includes on-chip USB2.0, so USB based PIC projects can be created and prototyped very easily.

Some hats created by the author for various applications will be included under the /hats directory.
